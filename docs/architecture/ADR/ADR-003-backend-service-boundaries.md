# ADR-003 — Backend: modular monolith on Supabase, multi-tenant by org_id

**Status:** Proposed (needs founder sign-off before implementation)

**Context.** SEEN will serve individuals, collectives, institutions ("facilities") and funders. The brief asks whether each facility needs its own server and whether to adopt microservices. The repo already contains a Supabase project reference and a Supabase Edge Function; the team is small; traffic is pre-launch.

**Decision.**
1. **One central multi-tenant platform.** Facilities/institutions are rows in `organizations`; tenant data carries `org_id`; isolation is enforced by Postgres Row Level Security, storage bucket policies, role checks inside policies, and an append-only `audit_log`. No per-facility infrastructure unless a specific legal, data-residency or contractual isolation requirement appears (then: a dedicated Supabase project for that tenant, same code).
2. **Modular monolith, not microservices.** Bounded contexts (SERVICE_BOUNDARIES.md) are separated in code and schema with typed contracts, deployed together on Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions). Split a context into its own deployable only when it has a different scaling, reliability or team-ownership need (payments webhooks and search indexing are the likeliest first candidates).
3. **Vercel + Supabase** is the testing and launch stack (Option B). Cloudflare Workers only for a demonstrated edge need (rate limiting, caching).

**Free-tier fit for user testing.** Supabase Free (2 projects, 500 MB DB, 1 GB storage, 50k MAU, projects pause after a week idle) and Vercel Hobby are sufficient for moderated testing with tens of users. Upgrade triggers: >300 MB DB or >800 MB storage, any paying users (Hobby is non-commercial), need for daily backups/PITR, or project pausing interrupting a test window. Verify current limits on the vendors' pricing pages before relying on them.

**Consequences.** Lowest operational load; tenancy correctness lives in RLS policies, so they need automated tests (pgTAP or Edge-function integration tests with two tenants). Each context can later be extracted without changing the UI contract.
